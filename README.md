# DoorDash

Please find attached the source code for the project submission. 

What I have covered:
1. google map api integration. 
2. Navigation Controller for the app
3. Search List Table View Controller
4. Search and Favorites tab bar controller
5. 20% unit test coverage
5. Tried to modularize the code to the best of my knowledge
6. Localization support
7. Decent scroll performance of tableview
8. Tried to build a better app with value types as much as possible. Inspired by Apple WWDC tech talk

Due to time constraints, I wasn't able to add
1. Documentation
2. No automation
3. Fit and Finish
4. code cleanup
5. My code is not super reusable per se. I could have done better with more time
6. Fix a lot of bugs I found

Please find the link to my github repo for the same: https://github.com/anpadmaja/DoorDash

I look forward for the feedback. Thank you for your time and consideration.
